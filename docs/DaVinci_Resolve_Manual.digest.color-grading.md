### Node Graph Architecture

<!-- TODO: Generate mermaid flowchart showing:
     - Serial vs parallel node connections
     - Input/output signal flow
     - Node types and their relationships
     See pages TBD -->

### Color Pipeline

<!-- TODO: Generate mermaid diagram showing:
     - Input → Color Space Transform → Grading → Output Transform
     - Where LUTs fit in the pipeline
     See pages TBD -->

### Scopes Decision Helper

<!-- TODO: Generate decision tree/flowchart:
     - Which scope for which task (Waveform vs Parade vs Vectorscope)
     - When to use Histogram vs Waveform
     See pages TBD -->

### LUT Placement Options

<!-- TODO: Generate diagram showing:
     - Timeline vs Clip vs Node LUT placement
     - Order of operations
