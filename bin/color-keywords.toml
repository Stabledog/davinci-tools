# color-keywords.toml
# Configuration for DaVinci Resolve Color section digest generation
#
# NOTE: Automatic boundary detection was removed. Page boundaries must be
# provided externally via environment variables or metadata file.
# This file now only contains digest generation configuration.

# ==============================================================================
# AUTOMATIC DETECTION CONFIGURATION - REMOVED
# ==============================================================================
# The following sections were removed as part of strategy shift:
#   [detection] - keyword density thresholds, window size, bookmark keywords
#   [keywords]  - primary, technical, scopes, color_management, workflow lists
#
# These were used for automatic section boundary detection via keyword density
# analysis, which proved unreliable across manual versions.
